  about: {
    summary: "Right now, I balance two roles: Android Developer and Lead Technical Support. It's an unusual combo, but it works. Dealing with frustrated users every day changed how I write code—I prioritize stability because I've seen what happens when things break.\n\nI also spend a lot of time mentoring. I've guided 100+ developers through IDCamp and Infinite Learning programs. Honestly, teaching others is how I learned to explain complex tech in simple terms. It keeps my fundamentals sharp.",
    longBio: "Fresh out of university in 2025, I jumped into two roles that most people don't mix: building Android apps and leading a technical support team. Sounds weird, but it makes sense to me. When you spend your mornings fixing user issues and your afternoons writing Kotlin, you naturally start writing better code.\n\nOutside work, I like tinkering. I mess around with Linux servers and backend stuff—not because I'm trying to become a DevOps engineer, just because I'm curious. Same with Machine Learning. I completed programs at Bangkit and DBS Foundation because I wanted to understand how it all connects.\n\nMentoring is something I genuinely enjoy. Between IDCamp and Infinite Learning, I've helped over a hundred developers get started. Teaching forces you to actually know your stuff, not just copy-paste from Stack Overflow.\n\nWhat's next? I'm planning to pursue a Master's in Business Technology or Applied AI. I want to combine what I know about building products with a deeper understanding of strategy and emerging tech.",
